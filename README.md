# 04-FCC-project3.1-Random-Quote-Machine-Simple

Simple webpage that creates a random quote from an external API
Using: Bootstrap
       jQuery
       SaSS

It is responsive for all screen sizes.
With this project I learned how to call an external API with the AJAX method of jQuery, and handling JSONP info.
I also practiced some jQuery animations and modifications of the DOM (for the Tweet).
